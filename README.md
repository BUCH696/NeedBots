## SimsBots - System Needs Bots
Unity 2021.3.11f

## Implemented Tasks
This project was created for a bot system for one of our team's projects. This project implements the Command and Global Update patterns. 
Implemented a system of necessities and a bot management system, as in Assassin's Creed.

I think it would also be appropriate to implement a Job System, Burst Compiler, Entity Component System here. I will work on this in the next versions of this system. Now we will continue the development of the project.
